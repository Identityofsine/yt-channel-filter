# Youtube Channel Filter
## A unique way of productivity. 

### What is Youtube Channel Filter
Youtube Channel Filter is a chrome extension designed to make youtube a *more productive* platform. 
This is done by letting the user select channels they think would be productive to their lives.

### What does the filter do?
The filter blocks out all recommendations from channels that are not approved(this can be reversed as well to hide channels you do not like) from the home page and video recommendations. However searching manually does not filter any videos.
### How Do I use it?
To add a channel to the filter, navigate to the channel's page and you'll see a gray button that says ***Add Channel***. *(if you do not see this, refresh the page)*
To remove a channel you can do two things. Either navigate to the chrome extension at the top right of your browser, click on it, and click on the channel you want to remove. Or you can navigate back to the channel's page and click the gray button that says ***Remove Channel*** *(Again if you do not see this, refresh the page)*
#### *There is a refresh rate option, depending on your internet speed you may want to make this higher or lower*

### How do I install?
To install this plugin as is you need to clone this repo, or download it as a zip. 
>Click CODE and click download as ZIP
After installing navigate to
>chrome://extensions
Click on the toggle switch on the top right labeled *Developer Mode*
You should see a button named **Load Unpacked**, click on this and navigate to the extracted folder.

#### This process should get a lot easier when it is uploaded to the chrome store.
